# Basic Platformer
## Motivation

This is a basic platformer game that I made during the holidays in my second year of uni as I wanted to teach myself how to write in C++ and use the SDL2 library. You play as a hero who must fight his way through the level slashing down enemies and crates along with collecting keys to open chests and collect coins.
